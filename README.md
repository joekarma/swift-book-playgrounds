# swift-book-playgrounds
A collection of Xcode playgrounds created while following along with the Swift Book.

This project was created to encapsulate the majority of the code I write while exploring the Swift programming language, which will mainly be according to examples from the [official Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).

Examples will be named by ISO format, yyyy-mm-dd, plus a descriptive label, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd-chapter-1. Where possible, code will be stored in playground format. Some exceptions may apply, in which case folder structures will be created following the same naming format as playgrounds.
