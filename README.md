# swift-book-playgrounds
A collection of Xcode playgrounds created while following along with the Swift Book.

This project was created to encapsulate the majority of the code I write while exploring the Swift programming language, which will mainly be according to examples from the [official Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).
